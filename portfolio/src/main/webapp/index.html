          <p>For most of my life, I've resided in sunny San Diego. I'm the first-born of three rambunctious children and a proud member of a mixed-race family.</p>

              I was introduced to computer programming during high school, at an IDTech Java summer camp. 
              After that, I wanted to learn more, so I took a Computer Science class at my school.
              Taking that class gave me the push to pursue this field as a career, and I have yet to look back.

              Since the waning of the PS2 age I've been a bit of a gamer. I started with mainly racing games, as most other genres were too violent by my parent's standards. 
              My latest love has been Soulslike games, and at the moment I find myself occupied with Sekiro and Dark Souls 2.

              Likely due to my early involvement with Gran Turismo, I've always found cars really neat. 
              For most of my life my knowledge was limited to trivia, but a year ago I got my first car to work on and learn the mechanical side of things.

              In addition to the above, I recently (2 years ago) got into fitness. 
              Once high school ended and I no longer participated in organized sports, I wanted something to do to stay active. 
              My dad had some dumbells in the garage and I gave them a try.
