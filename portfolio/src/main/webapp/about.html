          I was born on Oahu, Hawaii, but for most of my life, I've resided in sunny San Diego. I'm the first-born of
          three rambunctious children and a proud member of a mixed-race family.

            My mom's family comes from Saint Vincent, an island in the Caribbean. I visited once as a baby, but I
            haven't been back since. I'm hoping to return someday.

            We're not as sure about my dad's heritage but he has northwestern European ancestry.

          I was introduced to computer programming during high school, at an IDTech Java summer camp. After that, I
          wanted to learn more, so I took a Computer Science class at my school. Taking that class gave me the push to
          pursue this field as a career, and I have yet to look back.

            Since I was pretty young I've been into video games. Even before my brother started playing with the
            controller plugged in, the two of us have bonded over our shared interest. Unfortunately for him, I was
            always just a teeny bit better ;)
          </p>
          <p>
            I started with mainly racing games, then I graduated to Call of Duty and Battlefield. I had a brief stint
            with RPG's, and my latest love has been Soulslike games. At the moment I find myself occupied with Sekiro
            and Dark Souls 2.

          In part due to my early involvement with Gran Turismo, I've always found cars really neat. For most of my life
          my knowledge was limited to trivia, but a year ago I got my first car to work on and learn the mechanical side
          of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the above, I recently (2 years ago) got into fitness. Once high school ended and I no longer
          participated in organized sports, I wanted something to do to stay active. My dad had some dumbells in the
          garage and I gave them a try. I didn't enjoy it at first but over time it's become a sort of therapy for me.

          <h3>Guardian</h3>
          <p>
            I used the YoLo object-detection framework to implement a Link tracking system. When complete, the Guardian
            robot would be able to locate and track the figurine, like the Guardians from Breath of the Wild.
            Unfortunately, the integration stage was postponed, so the full robot isn't quite done.
